# NoiseCloud

A music streaming platform for users to enjoy their favorite songs

## Quick Note
I took on a legacy codebase for a music streaming application that originally held 1000 datasets and scaled the backend to host 42 million datasets. I also containerized the application using Docker to standardize the environment and deployed to Amazonâ€™s EC2 t2.micro instances while maintaining fast response times and performance.
